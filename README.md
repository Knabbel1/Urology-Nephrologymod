# Urology-Nephrologymod
Urology &amp; Nephrology Department This mod adds a department of Urology and Nephrology. 
Urology also known as genitourinary surgery, is the branch of medicine that focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the male and female urinary-tract system 
and the male reproductive organs. Organs under the domain of urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs.  
The mod contains new rooms and staff types together with new diagnoses with custom symptoms and treatments related to Urology. 
It currently adds 9 new diseases (15 new diagnoses) and 1 custom decal. However the Urology department treats up to 28 different diagnoses.  

Community Resource Pack CRP is needed for this mod to work. 
Urology is planned to also be converted into the CRP in the future.
